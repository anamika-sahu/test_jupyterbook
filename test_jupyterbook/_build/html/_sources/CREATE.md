# Create a template book
Now that we understand our book’s structure, let’s create a sample book to learn from.

Quickly generate a sample book
Jupyter Book comes bundled with a lightweight sample book to help you understand a book’s structure. 

Create a sample book by running the following command:

```jupyter-book create mynewbook/```

This will generate a mini Jupyter Book that you can both build and explore locally. It will have a few decisions made for you, 
and you can explore the configuration of the book in _config.yml and its structure in _toc.yml. 
Use this book as inspiration, or as a starting point to work from.
